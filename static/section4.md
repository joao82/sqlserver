## üîó CTE's Common Table Expressions:

The **common table expression (CTE)** is a powerful construct in SQL that helps simplify a query. CTEs work as **virtual tables** (with records and columns), created during the execution of a query, used by the query, and eliminated after query execution. CTEs often act as a bridge to transform the data in source tables to the format expected by the query.
<br>
A common table expression, or CTE, is a temporary named result set created from a simple SELECT statement that can be used in a subsequent SELECT statement. Each SQL CTE is like a named query, whose result is stored in a virtual table (a CTE) to be referenced later in the main query.
<br>
The best way to learn common table expressions is through practice. I recommend LearnSQL.com's interactive Recursive Queries course. It contains over 100 exercises that teach CTEs starting with the basics and progressing to advanced topics like recursive common table expressions.

Topics of this section:

- 1. CTE
- 2. Recursive CTE

### 1. CTE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION

You can define two or more CTEs and use them in the main query. In the next example, we show you how to divide and organize a long query using SQL CTEs. By naming different parts of the query, CTEs make the query easy to read.

```sql
WITH
    -- 1st CTE
    sales AS (
        SELECT
            OrderDate,
            OrderMonth = DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(OrderDate),MONTH(OrderDate),1),
            TotalDue,
            OrderRank = ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(OrderDate),MONTH(OrderDate),1) ORDER BY TotalDue DESC)

            FROM AdventureWorks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    ),
    -- 2nd CTE
    SalesMinusTop10 AS (
        SELECT
            OrderMonth,
            TotalSales = SUM(TotalDue)

            FROM Sales -- using 1st CTE
            WHERE OrderRank > 10
            GROUP BY OrderMonth
    )
    -- 3rd CTE
    ,Purchases AS (
        SELECT
            OrderDate
            ,OrderMonth = DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(OrderDate),MONTH(OrderDate),1)
            ,TotalDue
            ,OrderRank = ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(OrderDate),MONTH(OrderDate),1) ORDER BY TotalDue DESC)

            FROM AdventureWorks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader
    )
    -- 4rd CTE
    ,PurchasesMinusTop10 AS (
        SELECT
            OrderMonth,
            TotalPurchases = SUM(TotalDue)

            FROM Purchases -- using 3rd CTE
            WHERE OrderRank > 10
            GROUP BY OrderMonth
    )

    SELECT
        A.OrderMonth,
        A.TotalSales,
        B.TotalPurchases

        FROM SalesMinusTop10 A -- using 2nd CTE
            LEFT JOIN PurchasesMinusTop10 B -- using 4rd CTE
                ON A.OrderMonth = B.OrderMonth

        ORDER BY 1
```

### 2. RECURSIVE CTE

SQL Server offers **recursive Common Table Expressions**. A recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL Server allows you to perform recursive queries on hierarchical or graph-based data structures, such as organizational charts, family trees, transportation networks, etc. Recursive queries are used to **loop** through relationships between the data elements.

```sql example 1
WITH
    -- CTE
    DayMonthDates AS (
        -- Anchor member
        SELECT CAST('01-01-2021' AS DATE) AS FirstMonth
        -- loop over
        UNION  ALL
        -- looping conditions
        SELECT
            DATEADD(MONTH, 1, FirstMonth)
            FROM DayMonthDates
            WHERE FirstMonth < CAST('12-31-2021' AS DATE)
    )
    -- CTE are limited to the 1st SELECT query after the CTE
    SELECT
        FirstMonth

        FROM DayMonthDates
        OPTION (MAXRECURSION 120)
```

```sql example 2
WITH
    DateSeries AS (
        -- Anchor member
        SELECT CAST('01-01-2021' AS DATE) AS MyDate
        -- loop over
        UNION  ALL
        -- looping conditions
        SELECT
            DATEADD(DAY, 1, MyDate)

            FROM DateSeries
            WHERE MyDate < CAST('12-31-2021' AS DATE)
    )

    SELECT
        MyDate
        FROM DateSeries
        OPTION (MAXRECURSION 365)
```
